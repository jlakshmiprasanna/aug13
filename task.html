            <p>Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath
                Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older
                brother,
                Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his
                early
                education at Vishal Bharti Public School.According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for
                cricket
                as a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request his father to bowl to him.In 1998, the
                West
                Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli, who'd espoused his
                younger
                son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him to meet
                Rajkumar
                Sharma. Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a
                professional
                cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in gully
                cricket. Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14
                Delhi
                team, supposedly due to extraneous factors.</p>
